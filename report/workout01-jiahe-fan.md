Comments and reflections

Was this your first time working on a project with such file structure? If yes, how do you feel about it?

Yes. Very structured. And I feel like 'working out' finally it's nice

Was this your first time using relative paths? If yes, can you tell why they are important for reproducibility purposes?

Yes. I got stuck on the working directory thing in R script once, but I think figuring out is really important.

Was this your first time using an R script? If yes, what do you think about just writing code (without markdown syntax)?

Yes. It's pure and neat. You can still write the comments with pound sign so I think it's as convinient as rmd

What things were hard, even though you saw them in class/lab?

The working directory and stuff...

What was easy(-ish) even though we havenâ€™t done it in class/lab?

plotting! Love plotting

Did anyone help you completing the assignment? If so, who?

yes, I seeked help from my friend in class when I couldn't debug

How much time did it take to complete this HW?

Approximatly 8 hours

What was the most time consuming part?

debugging

Was there anything interesting?

Sense of Accomplishment?lol
